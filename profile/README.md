# SPATS Personal Asset Tracking Software

I have never found any software that was condusive to keeping track
of what I own.

At some point I had found [Homebox](https://hay-kot.github.io/homebox/)
but it both started after I started and has also been archived. It
does seem like it would have been somewhat useful in what I was
trying to accomplish, but it wasn't 100% of the way there.

So I am building this. I've gone thru many redesigns, I think this is
currently version 2.0. It was first built in Javascript and something
else and then I moved to doing it in Python and now I'm working on a
"3.0" version where I plan on switching from Flask for both the front
and back ends to Django for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.
